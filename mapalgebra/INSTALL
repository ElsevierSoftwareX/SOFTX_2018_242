Map Algebra uses the CMake to build, test, and install. CMake must be
installed on your system.  Most linux systems provide a verion of CMake
but you can check http://cmake.org for directions on installing CMake
on your system.

Map Algebra also requires MPI (http://mpich.org) and GDAL (http://gdal.org)
libraries to be installed. See the respective websites for instruction on
installing these packages on your system. In most cases CMake will 
automatically detect and use the libraries once they are installed on your
stystem.

Once CMake has been installed, the following commands can be used to
build Map Algebra. The commands provided below build in a seperate
directory from the source files.  

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
  $ make install

This will install two executables, mapalg and mapalg-kernel on your system
in /usr/local/bin. If you wish to install in a different directory you
may specify it on the cmake command line. Example use the following
to command to install in your home directory bin directory.

  $cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~ ../src
