Summary:  This code represents an implementation of a communication-aware framework for parallel spatially explicit agent-based models (SE-ABMs). Parallel SE-ABM must overcome the challenge of communication management for orchestrating many processor cores in parallel computing environments. This code synthesizes four interrelated components: agent grouping, rectilinear domain decomposition, a communication-aware load-balancing strategy, and entity proxies into a communication-aware framework and has been shown to scale to thousands of processor cores and support the simulation of billions of agents.  This code is a sample implementation to illustrate the implementation of a communication-aware framework without the complexities of a particular model.  Some dynamics have been included for example purposes, but further work would be needed to implement an agent-based model using this code.

Execution: In a Linux environment the code can be compiled and executed using a 'make run' command, which by default will use mpicc and mpirun to compile and execute the code in parallel, respectively. 

Compilation: The code can be compiled using a 'make' command.

If IPM is also compiled, further simulation performance information can be extracted.
